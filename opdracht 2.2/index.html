  <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
  <p>Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page.
    It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of
    the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.</p>
  <h2>What are HTML elements?</h2>
  <p>Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be
    displayed.</p>
  <h2>What is a tag?</h2>
  <p>An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will
    be displayed per the instructions of the element.</p>
  <h2>How does the browser use HTML to create what I
    see?</h2>
  <p>The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended
    the data to appear on the screen.</p>
